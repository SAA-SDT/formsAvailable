	<!-- The model below is intended serve as a basis for discussion. 
		I can think of various various pro and con with respect to it. The models are not complete, as
		my intention here is only to sketch the outlines of a possible solution. For example,
		<container> does not match the content model as presently defined in EAD 2002. 
		
	I also suggest that you take a look at <altformavail> and <originalsloc>, as it occurs to me that 
	though each of these elements is not defined appropriately, it seems reasonable to me
	to raise the possibility of adjusting the definition of each (and their content models)
	to address the "forms available" requirement. -->
